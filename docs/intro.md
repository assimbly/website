# Intro

In this section several Assimbly modules are explained.

## What is a module?

Assimbly is modular in design. Each module acts as a building block. Blocks 
build on top of other blocks. It depends on your use case what module you choose.


## Integration functions

An integration function is a piece of software that performs a certain role in an integration.

Examples:

1. connectors
2. services (ESB)
3. api's
4. brokers  

An integration function is build from various modules. An example of a connector:

Multiple integration functions together make the integration architecture. It's so to say the whole building:

In a [blog series on the architecture of Assimbly](https://raymondmeester.medium.com/architecture-of-assimbly-6e79fffc577d) this is explained in detail.
